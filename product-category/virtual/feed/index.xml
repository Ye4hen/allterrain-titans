										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Abrams X is a technology demonstrator tank unveiled in October 2022, a transition stage between the M1A2 SEPv3 and SEPv4 to the US Army&#8217;s next-generation tank.<br />
The tank is said to have a reduced weight and a deserted turret with a new gun, autoloader, a turret with a Kongsberg Protector RS6 30mm gun. Due to the hybrid power plant, the power can be adjusted from 750 to 1,500 hp, while the tank will consume 50% less fuel for the same operational radius as serial tanks, and will also have the ability to move quietly at low speeds and sound masking. The car is equipped with cameras with a 360° view, a complex of active protection Trophy and has elements of artificial intelligence.</p>
