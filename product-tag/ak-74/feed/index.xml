										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Airsoft copy of the AK-74M machine gun from the Chinese manufacturer E &amp; L Airsoft.<br />
Drives AK series from E &amp; L are distinguished by high quality of assembly and reliability of operation. According to the manufacturer&#8217;s statement, part of the parts for the drive housing are taken from the submachine gun and adapted for use in AEG, other elements of the housing are manufactured according to technologies and standards similar to the production of firearms.<br />
This Electropneumatic AK-74M replica from E &amp; L is a premium model of an airsoft AK. The high-quality assembly of the drive can hardly be evaluated other than &#8220;excellent&#8221; &#8211; all parts are scrupulously adjusted to each other, and there are no backlashes as a class. The use of strong steel of excellent quality has a good effect on the strength and impact resistance of the drive. The appearance of the machine, and the feeling when you hold it in your hands, make you doubt whether it is really a toy.</p>
